This study aims to apply techniques learned in the course “Multivariate Statistics for Big Data” to explore global energy trends in 2021 and their influence on GDP and happiness. The energy data is derived from the “bp Statistical Review of World Energy 2022/71st edition.” GDP and population data for 2021 are sourced from the “World Bank,” and happiness indicators are drawn from the “World Happiness Report 2022” for the year 2021. The energy dataset includes information on six types of energy—oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear energy, hydroelectricity, and renewable energy—from 64 representative countries across seven regions in 2021. 

Our analysis focuses on the relationships among these six types of energy and their correlations with GDP and happiness indicators. Various multivariate statistical techniques, including PCA, factor analysis, cluster analysis, canonical discriminant analysis, and partial least squares analysis, were employed. The results reveal the distinct contributions of different energy types to GDP and happiness. These findings offer a deeper understanding of the importance of energy and its influence on both current living conditions and future prospects. 

Oil, coal, and natural gas emerged as the top three most consumed energy sources, forming the foundation for the development of each country. However, their contributionsto GDP and happiness indicators vary. These insights prompt us to consider energy policy through the lens of short-term GDP growth and long-term well-being. While we cannot abandon traditional energy resources in the short term, there is a pressing need to develop sustainable energy sources. These are not only vital for our daily happiness but also for future GDP growth. Sound energy policies are crucial for the future of our planet and humanity, encompassing ecology, environmental sustainability, and public health. 

Due to data and content limitations, this study focuses primarily on GDP and happiness indicators for preliminary analysis.
